## Literature Review

Task management systems have become essential for collaborative software development. Numerous tools exist to fulfill this need, each with different levels of complexity, integration, and cost. The following is a brief overview of the most relevant systems and their relation to TaskNet's goals:

### Existing Solutions

- **Trello**: A popular Kanban-style board system. While intuitive, it lacks deep integration with GitHub issues without third-party tools or paid power-ups.
- **Jira**: Enterprise-grade task tracking with extensive features. However, its complexity and overhead make it less ideal for small, agile teams.
- **GitHub Projects & Issues**: Provides basic task management features directly tied to code repositories. Although powerful, it lacks a lightweight, customized frontend tailored for small teams.

### Motivation for TaskNet

Despite the wide availability of tools, there is a gap between:
- **Simple UI**
- **Low overhead** and **effective multi-user task assignment**
- **Open source flexibility** and **ease of setup**

TaskNet aims to fill this gap by:
- Providing a minimal but effective task tracking system
- Offering a clean interface without relying on external services
- Being fully open source and easy to contribute to
