# TaskNet Final Report

##  Project Overview

**TaskNet** is an open-source, lightweight task tracking system designed specifically for small teams (around 3 members). It integrates with GitHub Issues to provide a minimal yet effective project management workflow without relying on third-party services or complex configurations.

---

##  Objectives

- Provide a simple, intuitive interface for task management.
- Leverage GitHub Issues as the backend to minimize duplication.
- Ensure low setup time and no external dependencies.
- Support equal task distribution among team members.
- Deliver an open-source tool ideal for student groups and small dev teams.

---

##  Design Goals

1. **Simplicity** – Focused feature set with an intuitive UI.
2. **GitHub-Centric** – Fully built around GitHub Issues.
3. **Low Setup Overhead** – No database, minimal configuration.
4. **Team-Oriented** – Built for collaborative use by small teams.
5. **Open Source First** – Forkable, hackable, and contribution-friendly.
6. **Responsive UI** – Usable on both desktop and mobile.

##  Literature Review

Existing tools like **Trello**, **Jira**, and **Asana** are powerful but often overkill for small teams. They either lack GitHub integration or introduce unnecessary complexity. TaskNet fills the gap between developer-first task management and simple, effective UI by relying solely on GitHub Issues and Projects.
