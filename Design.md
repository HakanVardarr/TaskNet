## ðŸŽ¨ Design 

The design of TaskNet is guided by the following principles:

### 1. **Simplicity**
- Provide a minimal interface that is easy to understand and use.
- Avoid feature bloat; focus on the core: tracking and managing tasks.

### 2. **Low Setup Overhead**
- No complex database or configuration required.
- Easy to deploy locally or on a simple web server.

### 3. **Team-Oriented**
- Designed specifically for small teams (e.g., 2â€“5 people).
- Encourage collaboration, visibility, and balanced task distribution.

### 4. **Open Source First**
- Built to be transparent, forkable, and community-driven.
- Easy to contribute to, even for beginner developers.

### 5. **Responsiveness**
- UI should work well on both desktop and mobile devices.

These goals ensure that TaskNet remains a focused, reliable, and pleasant tool for small development teams.
